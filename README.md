# Android-Browser-ImageView-Player
Some fun work about creating a widget on the home screen, which should be able to redirect to any website (default browser), display pictures and play sounds.  Goals: - displaying any page in the default browser. - displaying the image in the ImageView Widget with the possibility of changing it. - play sound / song with the possibility of stopping, ending and moving to the next sound (minimum 2 sounds / tracks).
